%\begin{rSubsection}{Phoenix Team of Robotics}{2013 - 2016}{Project Manager}{University of Campinas, Brazil}
\begin{rSubsection}{Project Manager}{2013 - 2016}{Phoenix Team of Robotics}{University of Campinas, Brazil}
    %\item Led two successful teams with around 6 people each.
    \item Leader of project \tit{Piranha} (5 people team, 2015-2016):
        An autonomous mini-vehicle.
        First place in \tit{Robocore}'s latin-american 2016 robotics challenge, setting a new record.
    \item Leader of project \tit{Baleia} (7 people team, 2014-2015):
        An autonomous mini-vehicle.
        Third place in \tit{Robocore}'s latin-american 2015 robotics challenge.
    \item Helped design three autonomous robots, creating navigation,
        communication and computer vision systems.

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Researcher on Artificial Intelligence}{2016 - Present}{Institute of Computing (grant by CNPQ)}
    {University of Campinas, Brazil}
    %\item Working towards a framework for real-time vision
    %    allowing mobile robots to explore a variety of environments.
    \item Created \ttt{att}, a visual saliency detection system based on human
        vision written in Python.
        %Our preliminary results from MIT300 benchmark suggest performance
        %close to other models with similar architecture.
    \item Currently building a new model using Deep Learning to be used in real
        time by exploratory robots.
    %\item I am currently implementing state-of-the-art techniques for
    %    saliency detection using deep learning.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Researcher on High Performance Computing}{2014 - 2015}{Computational Mechanics Laboratory (grant by AMD)}{University of Campinas, Brazil}
    %\item Analysed Linux memory management policies for NUMA systems and multiple memory contention metrics.
    \item With Machine Learning, designed a predictive model to infer performance under
        various memory policies in ccNUMA systems, saving $66\%$ of time in
        determining the best policy for each program.
    \item Our work resulted in a paper accepted for ERAD-SP 2017 conference in Brazil.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Researcher on Computer Vision}{2013 - 2014}{Renato Archer Center of Technology (grant by CNPQ)}{Campinas, Brazil}
    \item Built a tool for real-time indoors tracking of
        mobile robots using OpenCV (C++). Compared to the older system,
        we achieved tracking of more objects
        and no need for special hardware (only webcams).

        design/administer programming assignments.
    \item GPA: 8.49/10 (above 92\% of class).
    \item Coursework in Control Engineering (2012-2014) including:
        Dynamics, Statics, Linear Systems.
    %\item Unicamp is ranked second best
    %    (overall and in Computer Science) in latin america according to
    %    QS rankings 2016.
