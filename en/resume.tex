\begin{rSubsection}{Project Manager}{2013 - 2016}{Phoenix Team of Robotics}{University of Campinas, Brazil}
    \item Lead two successful projects with around 6 people each.
    \item Helped design three autonomous robots and
        created Computer Vision solutions for robots using OpenCV.
    \item Leader of project \tit{Piranha} (2015-2016):
        An autonomous mini-vehicle capable of visual recognition of
        targets/obstacles.
        We got first place, setting a new record in \tit{Robocore}'s
        latin-american
        robotics challenge.
    %\item Leader of project \tit{Baleia} (7 people team, 2014-2015):
    %    An autonomous mini-vehicle.
    %    First newcomers in \tit{Robocore}'s latin-american competition to
    %    get to the podium.

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Researcher on Artificial Intelligence}{2016 - Present}{Institute of Computing (grant by CNPQ)}
    {University of Campinas, Brazil}
    \item Working towards a framework for real-time vision
        allowing mobile robots to explore a variety of environments.
    \item Created \ttt{att}, a visual saliency detection model written in
        Python that predict where people look on images.
        Our preliminary results from MIT300 benchmark suggest performance
        close to similar mature models.
    %\item I am currently implementing state-of-the-art techniques for
    %    saliency detection using deep learning.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Researcher on Computer Systems}{2014 - 2015}{Computational Mechanics Laboratory (grant by AMD)}{University of Campinas, Brazil}
    \item Analysed multiple Linux memory management policies for NUMA systems.
    \item Designed techiques for determining which memory policy
        to use via application profiling.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Researcher on Computer Vision}{2013 - 2014}{Renato Archer Center of Technology (grant by CNPQ)}{Campinas, Brazil}
    \item Built a tool for real-time indoors tracking of
        quadrotors using OpenCV\@. Compared to the older system,
        we achieved real-time tracking of twice as much objects
        and no need for special hardware (only simple webcams).

\begin{rSection}{Education}

    \begin{rSubsection}{B.S. in Computer Science/Engineering (in progress)}{2012 - Present}{University of Campinas (Unicamp)}{Campinas, Brazil}
    \item T.A. (2016) in \tit{Data Structures}. Helped
        teach and design/administer exercises sessions.
    \item In-major GPA: 3.25 (above 86\% of group).
    \item Coursework in Control Engineering (2012-2014) including:
        Dynamics, Statics, Linear Systems.
    %\item Unicamp is ranked second best
    %    (overall and in Computer Science) in latin america according to
    %    QS rankings 2016.
